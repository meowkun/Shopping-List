# Shopping-List
The app provides users with functionality to add or remove items from their reminder lists. Using Jetpack Compose, it offers a modern UI experience and is coded in Kotlin. By integrating the Google Maps API and Geocode API with Retrofit and Coroutines, users can obtain addresses by selecting a position on the map. When the add button is pressed, the app updates the shopping list in the ViewModel, displaying items with their name, quantity, and purchase location in lazy colum. Each shopping list item can be edited or deleted as needed.
